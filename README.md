Objective

The objective of this project was to strengthen my foundational Python programming skills by building a multi-module command-line application that demonstrates string manipulation, algorithm design, text analysis, and interactive game logic.

I focused on implementing core programming concepts manually (without relying on advanced libraries) to deepen my understanding of how these systems work under the hood.

# In this project, I built:
A multiple string-processing algorithms (slicing, character replacement, palindrome detection, index removal).
and an interactive 2D grid-based Tic-Tac-Toe game using nested lists.

# Designed a text analytics module that:
Cleans and tokenizes raw text
Calculates vocabulary size
Computes average word length
Identifies the longest word
Determines the most frequent word
Generated a dynamic HTML report from analyzed text data.
Implemented a menu-driven CLI system to tie all modules together into a single interactive application.
